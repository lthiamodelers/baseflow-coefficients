
README file for Application 3 Data Set
--------------------------------------

Section 4 of the LOADEST user documentation reads, in part:

"Note that the observed data used in the applications are for 
demonstration purposes only; individual data sets may not have
been checked for accuracy and compliance with USGS quality
assurance guidelines. Also note that the description of results
provided for each application is intentionally limited, and a
complete description of the statistical aspects associated 
with a given problem is beyond the scope of this report."

This statement is especially true for Application 3 that utilizes
data from the Potomac River at Little Falls/Chain Bridge.  The
calibration data set included herein has multiple observations of
orthophosphate concentration that are equal to 0.2511 mg/L.  These 
observations are not present in the USGS NWIS database and their
origin is unknown.  The data should therefore be viewed as "for
demonstration purposes only".
