*     Subroutine FACINV                       Called by: MATCALC, MATINV
*
*     factor and invert matrix A by gaussian elimination.
*
*     Based on Linpack routines DGECO and DGEDI (versions dated
*     08/14/78; Cleve Moler, U. of New Mexico, Argonne National Lab);
*     modified to eliminate computation of determinant.

*     local vars
*     ----------
*     IPVT    pivot indices
*     WORK    work space whose contents are usually unimportant. If A
*             is close to a singular matrix, then WORK is an approximate
*             null vector in the sense that norm(A*WORK) =
*             rcond*norm(A)*norm(WORK)

*     A       matrix to be factored and inverted
*     LDA     leading dimension of A
