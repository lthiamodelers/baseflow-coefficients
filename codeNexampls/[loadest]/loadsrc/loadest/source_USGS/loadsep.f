*     Subroutine LOADSEP                            Called by: AMLLOAD2
*
*     compute standard error of prediction (SEP), a measure of how
*     close the estimated sum of loads is to the true (unobserved) sum
*     that we wish to estimate.
*
*     SEP includes 3 components:
*
*        1) variance of the estimated sum (parameter uncertainty)
*        2) variability associated with random error around model
*        3) covariance of random errors between days (this component
*           is missing)
*
*     Notes: This is a crippled version of what could be a much richer
*     approach.  However, fitting a real time series model would
*     require much more frequent sampling than is available.  Thus it
*     is assumed that correlation between errors within days is 100%
*     and between days it is zero.  This is not as far off as it may
*     seem -- see Tim Cohn's working papers [1989].
*
*     If we ever figure out how to estimate RHO, then this routine
*     will need to be updated. (Tim Cohn 01/24/2002). Modified
*     21 JANUARY 2002 by T.Cohn.
