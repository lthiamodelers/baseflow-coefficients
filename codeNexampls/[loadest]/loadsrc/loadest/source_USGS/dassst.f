C      P (IN)  NUMBER OF PARAMETERS BEING OPTIMIZED.
C   STEP (I/O) ON INPUT, STEP IS THE STEP TO BE ASSESSED.  IT IS UN-
C             CHANGED ON OUTPUT UNLESS A PREVIOUS STEP ACHIEVED A
C             BETTER OBJECTIVE FUNCTION REDUCTION, IN WHICH CASE STLSTG
C             WILL HAVE BEEN COPIED TO STEP.
C STLSTG (I/O) WHEN ASSESS RECOMMENDS RECOMPUTING STEP EVEN THOUGH THE
C             CURRENT (OR A PREVIOUS) STEP YIELDS AN OBJECTIVE FUNC-
C             TION DECREASE, IT SAVES IN STLSTG THE STEP THAT GAVE THE
C             BEST FUNCTION REDUCTION SEEN SO FAR (IN THE CURRENT ITERA-

C        THIS ROUTINE IS CALLED AS PART OF THE NL2SOL (NONLINEAR
C     LEAST-SQUARES) PACKAGE.  IT MAY BE USED IN ANY UNCONSTRAINED
C     MINIMIZATION SOLVER THAT USES DOGLEG, GOLDFELD-QUANDT-TROTTER,
C     OR LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT STEPS.
C
C        SEE (1) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE ASSESSING AND MODEL
C     SWITCHING STRATEGIES.  WHILE NL2SOL CONSIDERS ONLY TWO MODELS,
C     ASSESS IS DESIGNED TO HANDLE ANY NUMBER OF MODELS.
C
C        ON THE FIRST CALL OF AN ITERATION, ONLY THE I/O VARIABLES
C     STEP, X, IV(29), IV(5), V(10), V(2), V(4), AND
C     V(7) NEED HAVE BEEN INITIALIZED.  BETWEEN CALLS, NO I/O
C     VALUES EXECPT STEP, X, IV(5), V(10) AND THE STOPPING TOLER-
C     ANCES SHOULD BE CHANGED.
C        AFTER A RETURN FOR CONVERGENCE OR FALSE CONVERGENCE, ONE CAN
C     CHANGE THE STOPPING TOLERANCES AND CALL ASSESS AGAIN, IN WHICH
C     CASE THE STOPPING TESTS WILL BE REPEATED.
