  Version: MOD48                                March 2013
  
  LOADEST is a program to estimate constituent loads by the rating
  curve method.  Daily or unit streamflow data are used with the
  rating curve to obtain the estimated loads.

  LOADEST and related materials are made available by the U.S.
  Geological Survey (USGS) to be used in the public interest and the
  advancement of science. You may, without any fee or cost, use, copy,
